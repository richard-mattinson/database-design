# EPIC
A local cinema wants to
- allow people to `book tickets` online to see `movies` that are being shown in its `various screens`. These tickets should be `delivered to customers via email`.
- The cinema wants to `keep a record` of their customers and the tickets they purchase, as well as offer a `regularly updated list of movies` for them to choose from.
- A single screen might show multiple movies a day, and even the same movie at multiple times.
- The cinema will expand its `number of screens` in the future, so the potential for growth needs to be accounted for.

# USER STORIES
